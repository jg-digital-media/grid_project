# JGDM Grid Project
**Last update:** 06-07-2021: 13:05


## About this project.

It started out as a simple re-design of a website project I first made in 2017 about CSS Grid when it was a bit newer than it is today. and the ideas kind of snowballed from there. I've turned it into a cloneble repository so anyone can use it and inspect it if they so wish.

The homepage for this website is divided into 3 sections of elements, each defined as a CSS Grid. The first 2 use ```grid-template-columns``` to lay out the "grid item" elements.

The third uses grid areas to assign a more custom layout to child elements of a grid area.

Grid is turned off on mobile screens where a 1 column layout is preferred where possible.

+ Create a Project root directory in your system ```mkdir create_a_project_root```.
